Aliases your current working directory to `p` so you can jump to your current
project every time you open a terminal.

Just run

riro
>>> set alias "p" to /Users/eoinmurray/Dropbox/macbook-pro/riro in /Users/eoinmurray/.bash_profile
```

It also makes a copies your .bash_profile beforehand into .bash_profile.riro for safekeeping.
